Title: Entanglement dynamics in hybrid quantum circuits; Summary: The central philosophy of statistical mechanics (stat-mech) and random-matrix theory of complex systems is that while individual instances are essentially intractable to simulate, the statistical properties of random ensembles obey simple universal "laws". This same philosophy promises powerful methods for studying the dynamics of quantum information in ideal and noisy quantum circuits -- for which classical description of individual circuits is expected to be generically intractable. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the dynamics of quantum information in ensembles of random quantum circuits, through a stat-mech lens. We begin by reviewing discoveries of universal features of entanglement growth, operator spreading, thermalization, and chaos in unitary random quantum circuits, and their relation to stat-mech problems of random surface growth and noisy hydrodynamics. We then explore the dynamics of monitored random circuits, which can loosely be thought of as noisy dynamics arising from an environment monitoring the system, and exhibit new types of measurement-induced phases and criticality. Throughout, we attempt to give a pedagogical introduction to various technical methods, and to highlight emerging connections between concepts in stat-mech, quantum information and quantum communication theory.
Title: Distributing Multipartite Entanglement over Noisy Quantum Networks; Summary: A quantum internet aims at harnessing networked quantum technologies, namely by distributing bipartite entanglement between distant nodes. However, multipartite entanglement between the nodes may empower the quantum internet for additional or better applications for communications, sensing, and computation. In this work, we present an algorithm for generating multipartite entanglement between different nodes of a quantum network with noisy quantum repeaters and imperfect quantum memories, where the links are entangled pairs. Our algorithm is optimal for GHZ states with 3 qubits, maximising simultaneously the final state fidelity and the rate of entanglement distribution. Furthermore, we determine the conditions yielding this simultaneous optimality for GHZ states with a higher number of qubits, and for other types of multipartite entanglement. Our algorithm is general also in the sense that it can optimise simultaneously arbitrary parameters. This work opens the way to optimally generate multipartite quantum correlations over noisy quantum networks, an important resource for distributed quantum technologies.
Title: Hierarchical Quantum Network using Hybrid Entanglement; Summary: The advent of a new kind of entangled state known as hybrid entangled state, i.e., entanglement between different degrees of freedom, makes it possible to perform various quantum computational and communication tasks with lesser amount of resources. Here, we aim to exploit the advantage of these entangled states in communication over quantum networks. Unfortunately, the entanglement shared over the network deteriorates due to its unavoidable interaction with surroundings. Thus, an entanglement concentration protocol is proposed to obtain a maximally entangled hybrid Omega-type state from the corresponding non-maximally entangled states. The advantage of the proposed entanglement concentration protocol is that it is feasible to implement this protocol with linear optical components and present technology. The corresponding linear optical quantum circuit is provided for experimental realizations, while the success probability of the concentration protocol is also reported. Thereafter, we propose an application of maximally entangled hybrid state in the hierarchical quantum teleportation network by performing information splitting using Omega-type state, which is also the first hierarchical quantum communication scheme in the hybrid domain so far. The present hybrid entangled state has advantage in circumventing Pauli operations on the coherent state by polarization rotation of single qubit, which can be performed with lesser errors.
